# CleanPad
CleanPad is a simple text editor, designed for making quick notes that don't need to be saved. It's primarily aimed at a call center environment, where sensitive data may need to be written down, but not saved.

In addition, it contains two extra features. A counter, which for example can be used to count the calls recieved, and a basic timer.
